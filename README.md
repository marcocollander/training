# I am a hobby programmer
I work as a maintenance technician on a daily basis. Programming is my passion. I like classical music. I am interested in politics, abstract 
art and culture. I am an eternal beginner who will eventually build an application that will bring fame and big money that will be mainly used 
for social purposes.
